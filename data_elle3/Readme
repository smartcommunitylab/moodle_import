Steps to follow to analyse the data of ELLE3 db in order to transform and prepare them for migration into moodle:

Step 1: update file config.ini in order to provide the credentials for connecting with ELLE3 SQL Server DB.

Step2: Execute each of the following python scripts in order to produce the csv files in the format that Moodle is expecting.
The order in which to run the scripts:

1. mig_an_activ-diario.py
2. mig_an_categories.py.py
3. mig_an_questonario.py
4. mig_an_users.py
